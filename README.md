# Healthcare-Care-Coordination-Platform
HealthTech Care Coordination Platform is a role-based hospital management web application designed to improve patient care efficiency despite complex hospital operations.
The platform centralizes patient workflows, appointments, clinical data, and hospital resources into unified dashboards for patients, doctors, nurses, and administrators.

The system focuses on reducing patient wait times, minimizing clinician overload, and improving operational visibility through real-time dashboards and analytics.
Designed in Figma, the project emphasizes realistic hospital workflows, accessibility, and scalability for large healthcare environments.

# Key Features:

• Patient portal with appointment booking, digital queue, and medical history.

• Doctor dashboard with prioritized patient queues and clinical summaries.

• Nurse workflow management with task tracking and shift handovers.

• Admin dashboard with hospital KPIs, bed occupancy, and operational analytics.

• Role-based UI, real-time status indicators, and efficiency-focused UX.

This project demonstrates HealthTech UX thinking, system design, and care coordination concepts aligned with real-world hospital operations.
